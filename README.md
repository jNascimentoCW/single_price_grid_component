# single_price_grid_component
A challenge from Frontend Mentor - A responsive Single Price Grid Component

This is an exercise from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62).

The goal was to build a statistic card looking as close as I could from the image and work thinking in a responsive way.

I also got to practice grid system and how to use vw for scale.
